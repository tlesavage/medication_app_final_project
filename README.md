###Problem Domain

As the number of medications you have to take increases many people have difficulty keeping track of everything. It can be stressful trying to remember when to take your next dose or if you have missed a dose. Often times new doctors will ask for a list of current medications and coming up with this can sometimes seem like a daunting task as you try to read all the tiny print on your pill bottles.

Our client needs something that can help keep track of the user's medications and because medications can change we need an application that is adaptable. We need to provide the user with an option to remove, add, and edit entries.

MedTracker requires a site that:

+ Allows the user see a list of upcoming medications 		
+ Alerts user if a dose is late
+ Allows user to check whether they took or skipped a dose
+ Shows user a chart displaying current streak of medication adherence
+ Allows user to see list of current medications and old medications
+ Allows user to edit current medications
+ Allows  user to add/remove medications

###Solution
As developers we seek to solve this problem through an appealing and user friendly app. We will have a dashboard on the homepage to help the user understand what is going on with their medications at a glance. From the homepage our user should be able to see a medications schedule and a chart with current medication adherence in order to encourage them to stay on track.

Our user should be able to easily navigate to other pages on the site with a clear navigation bar towards the top of the page.

The site will include the following pages:

+ Home/Dashboard
+ Add/Edit New Medications
+ Current Medications	
+ Archived Medications
+ About Us
